Abstract
This topic provides an overview of the Rebana, a tambourine drum and one of the traditional musical instruments popular in Southeast Asian countries. It is frequently used during Islamic religious ceremonies, including in the Malay area during wedding celebrations. 

Introduction
The music of the Malays is said to have originated from the Kelantan-Pattani region [1]. Its style has been influenced by music from India, China, Thailand, and Indonesia. Notably, Hindu India had a significant impact on the Malays, as they were predominantly Hindu before their conversion to Islam in the 15th century [2]. Additionally, cultural exchanges between the Malays and the Chinese may have occurred even before the legendary Chinese admiral Cheng Ho arrived in Malacca in 1405 [3]. Thailand and Indonesia, being neighbouring countries, also contributed to this rich musical heritage.

Malay music has served various purposes throughout history. It has been used to tell stories, often accompanying ceremonial rites, festivities, and post-harvest celebrations. Furthermore, it plays a role in recreation and competitions [4]. In East Malaysia, drums and other percussion instruments are integral to their music, often performed alongside other arts such as dance and puppet storytelling [5].

History and Origins
The Rebana boasts a centuries-old history, with its origins rooted in the Middle East. Initially known as the “daff” or “daf,” this percussion instrument gradually made its way to Southeast Asia through flourishing trade and cultural exchanges. Once there, it was embraced and modified by the local communities. Interestingly, the name ‘Rebana’ is derived from the Arabic word ‘robbana,’ which means ‘our Lord.’ The Rebana is one of traditional musical instruments in Malaysia. There are several types of Rebana, including Rebana Ubi, Rebana Ibu & Anak Dikir Barat, Rebana Asli, Rebana Mangkuk, and Rebana Perak. The Rebana consists of two essential components: the circular wooden frame and the goat skin stretched across the upper surface. When played, the player pats the skin to produce distinct tones [6].Rebana Ubi


The first instrument is the Rebana Ubi, which originated in Kelantan, Malaysia. The Rebana Ubi is the grandest instrument among all types of Malay Rebana, standing at least 1 meter high and having a diameter of 70 centimeters. Rebana Ubi ensembles compete with one another during post-rice harvest festivals, playing interlocking rhythmic patterns. Typically, two players perform on the Rebana Ubi, and they play it while standing. Rebana can also play it with drum rolls with a louder sound.

The second instrument used in Dikir Barat (Traditional dance) performances is called the Rebana ibu and Rebana anak. These drums have round faces with goat’s skin stretched over the body, secured by rattan straps to the rattan ring underneath. The pelvis is reinforced using a wooden hook between the ring and the base of the body.

The Rebana Asli is a single-sided frame drum that is a key instrument which can be played vertically and horizontally. Rebana Asli is also used in Dikir Barat (Traditional dance) performances together with Rebana Ibu and Rebana Anak. There are 2 sizes: 14 inch and 16 inch.

Rebana Perak

Rebana Perak is associated with musical instruments originating from the Arab world. It serves as entertainment for the Sultan of Perak, who frequently travels on the Perak River to entertain commoners and traders from Arab lands, accompanied by an entourage. The Rebana is crafted from wood, metal nails, and beef skin. Typically, this instrument is played during festive processions, spiritual gatherings, or community events.
